The Better SEO Slugs makes your post and pages permalinks more SEO friendly.

== Description ==

Better SEO Slugs was created to allow more control and better SEO for blogs using permalinks. As you know, a good SEO method is to use post title in the post/page url. However, this has a major disadvantage: The url can get pretty long and ugly.

Unlike similar plugins, Better SEO Slugs is more flexible and more SEO friendly. Here it what it makes it "better":

* Work with both posts and pages
* A list of common English words are already included in the plugin. All the words that are in the list will be automatically removed from your slug. The words have been chosen carefully. These are the words that are not important for your search engine ranking. You can add or delete words from this list.
* Automatically remove common (noise) words
* Automatically remove words with less then X letters (for example, any words with less then 4 letters)
* You can make your own list of "noise" words, in your own language (if other then English)
* Set maximum slug length (for example, no more then 30 characters)
* EXCLUSIVE FEATURE: set a protected keywords list. No matter what your other settings are, some keywords will be always kept. This is VERY important when your want to optimize for keyphrases that contain common words and/or short words (that would been otherwise removed).

= Example =

* If on your health blog you make a post named "What are the best weight loss pills on the market" you will get an url like http://www.youdomain.com/what-are-the-best-weight-loss-pills-on-the-market/. That looks good but can be better!
* With Better SEO Slugs plugin the url of the post will become http://www.youdomain.com/best-weight-loss-pills/

== Installation ==

1. Upload `better-seo-slugs` directory from ZIP-archive (if you install from standalone ZIP file) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (in the end it should look like /wp-content/plugins/better-seo-slugs/better-seo-slugs.php etc.)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. When you add a new post/page, give it a title and press Save. The plugin will generate a slug according to your settings. If you edit a page/post, the plugin will honor your slug and won't change it. If you want to change the slug of an existing post, click Edit for the slug and then remove everything from there. Publish/Save the post and a new slug will be generated.
